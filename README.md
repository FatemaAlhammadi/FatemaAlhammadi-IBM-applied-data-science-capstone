:rocket: Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone project is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. It integrates all the concepts and skills acquired throughout the specialization into a comprehensive project.

:page_facing_up: Project Background
SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry, making space travel more affordable. The company offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million each, compared to other providers that charge upwards of $165 million. This significant cost reduction is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of their rockets. By predicting the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This project uses public data and machine learning models to predict whether SpaceX will be able to reuse the first stage.

:page_facing_up: Questions to be Addressed
How do factors like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit type influence the success of the first stage landing?
Has the rate of successful landings increased over the years?
Which algorithm is most effective for binary classification in this context?
